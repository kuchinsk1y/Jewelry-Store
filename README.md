# Jewelry Website Documentation
# Overview
This project is a simple jewelry website built using HTML, LESS, and Bootstrap. The site consists of two main pages: a Home Page and a Catalog Page. It features a responsive layout with CSS Grid, a burger menu for mobile navigation, a product filter system (currently not functional), and a modal window for various interactions.

# Technologies Used:
HTML: Structure and content of the website.
LESS: Preprocessor for styling.
Bootstrap: For responsive design and some built-in components like the navbar.

# Pages
1. Home Page (index.html)
Header: Includes a burger menu for responsive mobile navigation.
Featured Section: Displays featured jewelry items or offers.
Modal Window: Implemented using Bootstrap to display pop-up content (e.g., product details, signup form).

2. Catalog Page (catalog.html)
Filters: Includes filters for product categories like price, type, and material. These are static for now and will require JavaScript for full functionality.
